============

Frontend for the class registration system.

To run the app:

Clone the project and navigate into its directory.
Make sure you have node.js installed:

```
node --version
```

Run the server like this (you'll probably want to do this in a different terminal tab/window):

```
node ./scripts/web-server.js
```

The app is now running at [http://localhost:8000/app/index.html](http://localhost:8000/app/index.html).
